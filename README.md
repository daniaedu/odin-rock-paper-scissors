Project 3: Rock Paper Scissors

Description:

 This Rock Paper Scissors game is a personal project to improve my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows you to challenge the computer in a classic game of chance and strategy.

Current Features:

- Play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
- Choose your move (Rock, Paper, Scissors) by clicking buttons.
- Clear indication of your choice and the computer's choice.
- Scores (wins, losses, ties) update dynamically on the DOM after each round.
 
Planned Improvements (For Future Exploration):

- Implement a reset button to restart the game and clear scores.
- Allow players to choose the number of rounds to play before starting.
- Improve code structure and readability for future development.
- Enhance CSS styling for a more visually appealing interface (future exploration).

Technologies Used:

1. HTML (Structure)
2. CSS (Styling)
3. JavaScript (Functionality)
